# Matplotlib_challenge

This work is mainly to analyze two key table and then merge them together.

Difficult points:
1. It is difficult to get the corresponding results just by following the instructions in the text.
2. It is very difficult to display four box plots on the same chart at the same time.
3. It is very difficult to make a table with only one line.
