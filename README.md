# Matplotlib_challenge

This work is mainly to analyze two key table and then merge them together.

The difficult part:
1. It is difficult to get the corresponding results just by following the instructions in the text.
2. It is very difficult to display four box plots on the same chart at the same time.
3. It is very difficult to make a table with only one line.

The easy part:

1. It is easy to use "pyplot" and "Pandas" to make the same chart.
2. Finally, it is easy to write the function in the scatter plot, but it is difficult to write all the lines. It is easy to make the template for all the lines needed.
3. It is not difficult to clean up the data in the first place, but what is difficult is how to find out the problem of the data by using various methods, whether there are duplicates, missing or many NAH contents. This part may need to be more refined.

The assignment in this part can show us how to export the data directly from Python after analyzing the data without the help of Excel.
